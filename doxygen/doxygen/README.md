This is a Doxygen project setup derived from [IntelligentDV Test Project](https://github.com/SeanOBoyle/DoxygenFilterSystemVerilog).
Some files have been recreted to let them be kdistribited under the Apache 2.0 license (as the original
IntelligentDV code is licensed under GPLv3 or later).

Note that this is a minimal working example. For reuse, one would automate generation of the
Template Delta file to avoid needing to edit it every time.
