# If proper coding style is used, then *.svh files are only included. If we let
# Doxygen process also *.svh files, it will include their contents twice (once
# as a standalone file and second as a part of the file that includes it).
# Downside of it is that the include files won't appear in the list of API DOC
# files and their source code won't be indexed.
