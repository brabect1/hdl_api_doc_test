hdl_api_doc_test
================

This repository is to test some API Doc generators for SystemVerilog code and provide example setup and output.

Doxygen
-------

Doxygen is an API generator with a rich feature set. It has been the best choice for C/C++ projects
but it supports a number of other programming languages, incl. VHDL. Unfortunately there is no support
of SystemVerilog.

Unlike with Natural Docs (see later), there is no easy way to support a new language in Doxygen as
it needs to understand the syntax. This usually requires a full parser of the target langiage. Another
way is to use a workaround in a form of a *filter*, which translates the target language into a language
that Doxygen understands.

This is the way how IntelligentDV (iDV) introduced SystemVerilog to Doxygen (by translating to C++).
While iDV seems to be long gone, their SV filter code is hosted at [Github](https://www.github.com/SeanOBoyle/),
but no longer maitained.

The solution has some *glitches*, but otherwise it turns to be pretty effective.

### Running `doxygen` Example ###

Output of the following process on the prepared example is in `doxygen/generated/api/` (for
online preview see [here](https://brabect1.github.io/hdl_api_doc_test/doxygen/generated/api/)).

First, make sure to install some recent Doxygen version and GraphViz:

```
# Install needed components
# (libgtk2.0 is for GraphViz to support PNG and other raster formats)
sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libgtk2.0-dev

# Install Doxygen
cd /tmp
wget http://ftp.stack.nl/pub/users/dimitri/doxygen-1.8.14.src.tar.gz
tar xzf doxygen-1.8.14.src.tar.gz
cd doxygen-1.8.14 && mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=... -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
make
make install

# Install GraphViz
cd /tmp
wget https://graphviz.gitlab.io/pub/graphviz/stable/SOURCES/graphviz.tar.gz
tar xzf graphviz.tar.gz
cd graphviz-2.40.1/
./configure --prefix=...
make
make install
```

Then run the example from `doxygen/doxygen` using the `makefile`:

```
# Generate API doc
cd doxygen/doxygen
make WITH_DOXYGEN=.../doxygen WITH_GRAPHVIZ_DOT=.../dot

# View API doc
firefox ../doc/api/index.html
```

Natural Docs 1.x
----------------

Natural Docs does not need to fully comprehend a language sysntax, but only needs how to identify
comments and certain syntax attributes. This makes the tool applicable to a large number of languages
with very little porting effort.

Natural Docs has been used to generate API documentation for UVM. Hence one can use UVM code
distribution as a reference (e.g. https://github.com/chiggs/UVM) and adapt it to her needs.

### Usage ###

Natural Docs ... project ... Languages.txt ... Menu.txt

### Running `nd` Example ###

Output of the following process on the prepared example is in `natural_docs/generated/api/` (for
online preview see [here](https://brabect1.github.io/hdl_api_doc_test/natural_docs/generated/api/)).

```bash
# Install NaturalDocs 1.x
wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/naturaldocs/Stable%20Releases/1.52/NaturalDocs-1.52.zip
mkdir nd && cd nd && unzip ../NaturalDocs-1.52.zip && export WITH_ND=$(pwd)/NaturalDocs

# Generate API doc
cd natural_docs/nd_proj/ && make

# View API doc
firefox ../doc/api/index.html
```
