
Title: APB Agent UVM Verifivation Component

This UVC (UVM Verification Component) implements a simple APB bus agent.
The agent consists of lower level components that yield initiating and
monitoring bus transactions.

The agent may operate in an active mode, in which it instantiates all the
usual UVC comonents (driver, sequencer, monitor). In a passive mode, the
agent instantiates only the monitor.
