
Title: APB Agent UVM Verifivation Component

This UVC (UVM Verification Component) implements a simple APB bus agent.
The agent consists of lower level components that yield initiating and
monitoring bus transactions.

Components of the agent
- Driver (class <apb_driver>)
- Monitor (class <apb_monitor>)
- Sequencer (class <apb_sequencer>)
- Coverage monitor (class <apb_coverage_monitor>)

The agent may operate in an active mode, in which it instantiates all the
usual UVC comonents (driver, sequencer, monitor). In a passive mode, the
agent instantiates only the monitor. The operation mode as well as other
features are controlled through an agent's configuration object (class
<apb_agent_config>).

The agent may be paired with a UVM register model through an adapter class
<reg2apb_adapter>.
